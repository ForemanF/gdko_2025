Building ideas:
Repair building, is a person who goes around and repairs damaged structures
Medic building - recruit medics
Ranger - bow and arrow units
Knight - Knight units
Horse Warriors
Archer Tower

Look into a farmer house? - used to increase the population?



Resources:
Gold Mine
Trade tower?



Other ideas:
Can spend gold on "boons" every so often - random perma upgrades


Should add a little wood block when they harvest, same for stone
